# Circuit Component Classifier

This project focuses on **classifying circuit components (e.g., resistors, batteries, voltmeters, diodes, etc.)** using machine learning techniques.  
It aims to automatically recognize electronic components from images and assist in building datasets for educational or industrial applications.

## Features
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Model training for component classification
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Prediction on new unseen component images
- Visualization of training results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SKLearn
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PIL
